Chadle is inspired from the growth cycles in nature. 

In nature everything grows as a whole, as a system. All the elements of a system transform an adapt to accommodate the various stages of growth.

For example, the outer layer of a seed fulfills the purpose of protecting the seed throughout the growth cycles of the seed. 

But this is not the case with human lifestyle. Throughout our life cycle, we use various products that fulfill various needs of a particular stage. No product grows along with the human. 

For example, to fulfill the purpose of sitting, different chair are designed for different age groups.

We discard the products we outgrow, and this is not sustainable.

With Chadle, the idea was to design a product that grows and transforms with the human. A product that accommodates various stages of the growth cycle.
