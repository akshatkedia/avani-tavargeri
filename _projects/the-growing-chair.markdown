  text: "In nature everything grows as a whole, as a system. All the elements of a
    system transform and adapt to accommodate the various stages of growth.\n\nFor
    example, the outer layer of a seed fulfills the purpose of protecting the seed
    throughout the growth cycles of the seed. "

  text: "\n\nBut this is not the case with human lifestyle. Throughout our life cycle,
    we use various products that fulfill various needs of a particular stage. No product
    grows along with the human. \n\nFor example, to fulfill the purpose of sitting,
    different chairs are designed for different age groups.\n\nWe discard the products
    we outgrow, and this is not sustainable.\n\nWith Chadle, the idea was to design
    a product that grows and transforms with the human. A product that accommodates
    various stages of the growth cycle. "
