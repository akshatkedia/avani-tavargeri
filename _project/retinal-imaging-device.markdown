  text: 'I worked on this project as a part of my graduation project. We developed
    a low cost retinal imaging device to enable rural healthcare setups to get access
    to easier and affordable eye diagnostic devices. This project was a collaboration
    between Maker''s Asylum (a makerspace in Mumbai) and Dr. Rohit Modi (Ophthalmologist). '

    This project involved understanding in depth about the eye and learning about the various diagnostic procedures and equipment. Analyzing the existing scenario and recognizing the need of affordable retinal imaging was part of the process. Identifying the scope and widespread effects of designing a product which allows easy, stable
    and affordable imaging were the major drivers that defined the solutions obtained through this project.
