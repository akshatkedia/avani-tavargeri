  text: 'After Ink was designed to include all the essential items required for taking
    care of a tattoo in its initial days to ensure good health of your tattoo. The
    packaging itself acts as a container to store the contents after purchase. '

  text: The after care kit had a very bold, rugged look. The beige and black color
    scheme relates to the tattoos etched on skin and adds to the boldness and robustness
    of the product. The hexagonal structure enhances the look and makes the product
    stand out.
