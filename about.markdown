Hi, my name is Avani. I am a Product and User Experience designer based out of Pune, India. I am completely involved in the work I do and like to build designs that provide engaging experiences to the users. In my free time I love to draw, sketch and try my hand at brush lettering. I am professionally trained as a Kathak dancer and absolutely love performing this art.
